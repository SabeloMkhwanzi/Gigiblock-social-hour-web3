#### Problems we are Solving

- High commission charge, long payment process
- Extensive screening communication, big projects only
- No quick application â€“ must apply from each job vacancyâ€™s source
- Complex interface, spam applicants, and fake clients
- Lengthy selection process, high service fee

#### How its work

- We created a smart contract that allows a client to mint opened projects or skilled person to mint their information of career.
- Unstoppable domain to login users or RainbowKit
- That data is minted on the Polygon testnet, and than its store on a decentralized manner using IPFS and Nft.Storage.
- Infomation is visiable to public, no extensive screening proces and Lengthy selection process, we are using the blockchain to pay only for gas fees on Polygon to process application and posted projects.
- We than select our field of intrest or the talent for our project - Using XMTP (Extensible Message Transport Protoco) a open protocol and network for secure and private web3 messaging to connect and get more information on the applicants or the company - by only using you chain address to communicate.
